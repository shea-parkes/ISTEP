# The hunt for a good education.

As kindergarten looms just over the horizon, my wife and I find ourselves wanting to know about school performance in our city (Indianapolis).  There are data on the internet related to performance, but there is no analysis or insight that meets my rigor.  Therefor, I'm going to fill in that gap.

I might also pay down some hacking debt and try out the Shiney platform by the team at RStudio.
